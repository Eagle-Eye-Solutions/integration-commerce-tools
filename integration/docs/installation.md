# Plugin Installation

This plugin is a Node.js application that can be deployed in different ways and with different configurations.

## Commercetools connect

This plugin is certified and available to install via commercetools Connect.

For detailed instructions on how to deploy this plugin under Connect, head over to
their [official documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#deploy-a-connector). Here's a
summary of the required steps to deploy in production:

- Search for the connector (searching for "eagleeye" should be enough). Take note of properties like `id`/`key`
  and `version`. Also, look at the configuration variables (also available below in this document).
- Prepare your payload to request a deployment based on the previous step.
- Request a deployment.
- Monitor the deployment process by getting the deployment details by `id`/`key`.

For this plugin, the connector provides three applications:

- a `service` type, which is synchronous, handles cart creation/updates and "opens" transactions/saves EagleEye baskets.
- an `event` type, which is asynchronous, handles order creation/updates and "settles"/confirms transactions.
- a `job` type, which is synchronous, handles cleaning up old stored EagleEye baskets (if using Custom Objects).

After these steps are completed successfully, your connector should be ready to use. Don't worry about needing to setup
subscriptions/extensions, there's a default configuration for them and it's applied automatically by Connect using their
post-deploy/pre-undeploy [scripts](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/convert-existing-integration#adding-automation-scripts).

Customizing/deploying a version of the connector with code changes requires creating/publishing your own (can be
private). Check [this documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/development) for more details.

## Other deployment strategies

Since this plugin is just your standard Node.js application, it can be deployed to many different
services/platforms/hardware setups. This plugin is also stateless by default, only saving/checking certain states
directly in commercetools as [Custom Objects](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/custom-objects).

A very basic Dockerfile is provided in the repository, but feel free to make your own or run through other methods
like `pm2`, GCP CloudRun or any other (some additional code changes might be needed).

The commercetools configuration (extension/subscription creation and custom types), which is automatically done using CT
connect, should be done manually when using a different hosting strategy by running the `connector:post-deploy:*`
and `connector:pre-undeploy:*` scripts.

Extension, Subscription and cleanup job modules share the same source code. The same artifact must be deployed, only different
endpoints will be used.
The extension module is triggered via a POST request to `/cart/service`.
The subscription module is triggered via a POST request to `/events`.
The cleanup job is triggered via a POST request to `/jobs/stored-basket-cleanup`.

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured via environment variables. Each deployment strategy has a different way of defining
environment variables, refer to the specific deployment documentation for further information.

## Interaction with other extensions

If an API call triggers multiple API Extensions, they will be called in parallel. Their responses will be merged but
without a guaranteed order. For example, if the EagleEye plugin is installed together with an extension to calculate
taxes, the latter should run after promotions are calculated. In this case, a different solution should be adopted to
guarantee the ordering.
See [commercetools documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/api-extensions#multiple-api-extensions-in-a-single-api-call).
